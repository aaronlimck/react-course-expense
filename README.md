This project was created with Create React App for the purpose of:
- Understanding React basics 
- Working with components 
- React State 
- Working with Events 
- Rendering Lists and Conditional Content

## Technicalities
Node.js is required to run this web app. Here's a list of readily-provided scripts:

- `npm install` - downloads all the required dependencies 
- `npm start` - starts a local server for development
- `npm run build` - build the files for production in dist folder
- `npm run serve` - starts a local server to preview production build
